        Years before Christopher Columbus stepped foot on 
        what would come to be known as the Americas,
         the expansive territory was inhabited by Native 
         Americans. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, 
         as more explorers sought to colonize their land,
          Native Americans responded in various stages, 
          from cooperation to indignation to revolt.After 
          siding with the French in numerous battles during
           the French and Indian War and eventually being 
           forcibly removed from their homes under Andrew
            Jacksonâ€™s Indian Removal Act, Native American populations were diminished in size and territory by the end of the 19th century.
